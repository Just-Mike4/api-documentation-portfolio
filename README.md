# 🧩 API Documentation Portfolio  
### by Ezeana Micheal — Technical Writer | Backend Developer | CTO @ Synoloop Solutions

Welcome to my **API Documentation Portfolio**.  
This repository showcases a collection of **well-structured, developer-friendly API documentations** written in Markdown.

Each example demonstrates clarity, consistency, and real-world usability — the same standard I apply when documenting APIs for production systems.



## 💡 About Me

I’m **Ezeana Micheal**, a backend engineer and technical writer specializing in **API documentation, developer manuals, and SDK guides**.  
I currently serve as **CTO at Synoloop Solutions**, where I lead software and SaaS development.

My background in Python (Django REST Framework) and full-stack engineering allows me to understand APIs from both the developer and user perspectives — ensuring that documentation is not just readable, but truly usable.



## 📚 Portfolio Projects

Each folder below contains a self-contained Markdown documentation (`README.md`) for a specific API or developer use case.
